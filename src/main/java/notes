The Retail Store Discounts

Time: 45 minutes

On a retail website, the following discounts apply:
If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount).
The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.

Write a Spring Boot Java application with test cases, which exposes an API such that given a bill, it finds the net payable amount. 
Please note the stress is on object oriented approach and test coverage. User interface is not required, only an API exposed. What we care about:

object oriented programming approach, provide a high level UML class diagram of all the key classes in your solution. 
This can either be on paper or using a CASE tool
unit test and code coverage
code to be generic and simple
leverage today's best coding practices
clear README.md that explains how the code and the test can be run and how the coverage reports can be generated
state what you will use to document your API, with an example sample request and response

Create a GitHub repository, ensure the name is generic and doesnâ€™t have any company names. 
Commit your code to the GitHub repository and share the link with us.


Follow up Discussion

After completing the exercise please send an email to the recruiter who sent you the tests with the GitHub link. 
We will then schedule a follow-up discussion to discuss the key decisions, assumptions and rationale for your implementation.
